# electron-react-todo-app
Make a desktop todos application with electron + reactjs

Open terminal and run:

`cd electron-todo-api`

`cp .env.example .env`

Open `.env` on editor and change the DB_CONNECTION to some drive do you want (you can use sqlite but it more complicate so try some way easy for you)

`php -S localhost:8000 -t public`

Open another terminal and run:

`cd electron-todo`

`yarn electron`

Make sure you install *node_modules* (for electron-todo) and *composer install* for (electron-todo-api)

Enjoy it!
